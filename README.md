## Similar Question Detection

*Introducing our Similar Question Detection System - ask a question and get the top 5 most similar questions in seconds.
Say goodbye to redundant questions and get the answers you need faster than ever before.*

The Internet has become our go-to place to look for answers to our questions. This has led to the rise of question-answering websites. Many users on these Question and Answer (Q&A) websites end up asking similar questions. The aim is to design and implement a Semantically Similar Question Detection System that will provide the existing questions and their answers from the input questions with the Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques in combination with Machine Learning or/and Deep Learning techniques. The similar question detection system helps reduce the redundant question on question and answer websites. Users can find answers to their questions without having to explicitly search for them and the users who answer these questions don't have to rewrite their answers. As a result, there is less data, and improves the overall quality of these Question and Answers (Q&A) websites.
